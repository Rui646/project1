    <p>New York, often called New York City (NYC) to distinguish it from the state of New York, is the most populous city in the United States.</p>

      <p>The Statue of Liberty started as a romantic idea and became the most monumental gift in American history. Today, it stands as a singular symbol of hope and spirit.</p>

      <p>Ellis Island may not appear large on a map, but it is an unparalleled destination in United States history. After welcoming more than 12 million immigrants to our shores, Ellis Island is now a poetic symbol of the American Dream.</p>

        <h3> <i>Happy 20th Anniversary, Ellis Island Immigrant Database!</i> </h3> <h4>by Genealogy Life</h4>
        <dd>In April of 2001, a miracle occurred. Well, it certainly seemed that way at the time. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation (SOLEIF) opened the American Family Immigration History Center (AFIHC), launching an online database — digitized and indexed — of the passenger records of millions of immigrants who took their first steps in America at Ellis Island.Fast forward 20 years, and we expect genealogical companies to provide fresh databases weekly, but I’d like to try to convey what a big deal this was. It was — quite literally — national news.</dd>

        <h3> <i>Liberty’s controversial past finally acknowledged</i></h3> <h4>by The Australian </h4>
        <dd>In the current political climate, opening a new museum at the Statue of Liberty would seem an invitation to controversy. The US is in the midst of its most bitter debate on immigration for generations and, inevitably, the world’s best-known symbol of hope and freedom has been caught up in rhetoric during the Trump presidency.</dd>
